4-Card Golf – Complete Rules (4 Players, All Pair Matches Cancel)
🎯 Objective
Have the lowest total score after each player has taken exactly 4 turns. Create matching pairs to cancel out points anywhere in your 2×2 grid.

🧩 Setup
Use a standard 52-card deck (no jokers).


Deal each player 4 cards face-down arranged in a 2×2 grid:

 sql
CopyEdit
[ top-left     top-right ]
[ bottom-left  bottom-right ]


Each player may secretly look at their two bottom cards (bottom-left and bottom-right) at the start of the game — but must not show anyone and must not flip them over.


The rest of the deck goes in the center as the draw pile.


Turn the top card face-up to start the discard pile.



🔁 Gameplay
Play proceeds clockwise.


Each player takes exactly 4 full turns in a round.


On your turn, choose one action:

➤ 1. Draw from the draw pile
Look at the card.


You may:


Swap it with one of your face-down cards.


That card is flipped face-up and locked in place.


The card you replaced is placed face-up onto the discard pile.


Or discard it directly if you don’t want it.



➤ 2. Pick up the top card from the discard pile
You must swap it with a face-down card from your grid.


The new card is placed face-up.


The replaced card is discarded face-up.



🔒 Once a card in your grid is face-up, it cannot be changed again.
 👁️‍🗨️ You may never look at your face-down cards unless you're swapping them.

🛑 End of Game
After every player has taken 4 turns, the game ends immediately.


All players then reveal their remaining face-down cards.


Proceed to scoring.

➤ Matching Pair Cancel Rule
Any two cards in your 2×2 grid that are the same rank cancel each other out and score 0 points.


Canceled pairs can appear in:


Rows (horizontal)


Columns (vertical)


Diagonals (e.g., top-left & bottom-right)


⚠️ Only two matching cards cancel — if you have three-of-a-kind or four-of-a-kind, only one pair cancels.

🧮 Example Grid:
cpp
CopyEdit
[ 6♠   Q♠ ]
[ J♣   6♦ ]
→ 6♠ and 6♦ → pair → cancel to 0 pts
→ Q = 10 pts, J = 0 pts
→ Final score = 10

Another example:
cpp
CopyEdit
[ 7♦   5♠ ]
[ 5♥   7♣ ]
→ 7♦ & 7♣ → pair → cancel to 0
→ 5♠ & 5♥ → pair → cancel to 0
→ Final score = 0 ✅


🧠 Strategy Tips
Use your memory: only 2 cards are known!


Target pairs across the whole grid — diagonals count.


Avoid face cards unless you know they're part of a pair.


Turns are limited — only 4 total per player, so don’t wait too long to act.
