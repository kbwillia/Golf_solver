    Calculate the expected value (EV) of drawing from the deck vs taking the discard card for the specified player.
    If no player is specified, defaults to game.players[0] (for backwards compatibility).

    In Golf, **lower scores are better**. Here, EV is defined as the **expected change in score**:
        - A **negative EV** means your score is expected to go down (good).
        - A **positive EV** means your score is expected to go up (bad).

        - draw_advantage: Difference between draw_expected_value and discard_expected_value (negative = draw is better)

    Calculation details:
    1. **Discard EV**: For each available position in your grid, try swapping in the discard card and calculate the change (test_score - current_score). The best (most negative) change is used as the discard EV.
    2. **Draw EV**: For each possible card you could draw, calculate the best (most negative) change (swap or flip), weighted by probability
    3. **Interpretation**: Negative EV means a drop in your score (good in golf).
